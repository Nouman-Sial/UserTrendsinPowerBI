The Google Data Analyst Professional Certificae provided a large dataset for the capstone project. The idea is to ensure that all aspects of data analysis process are applied on a business problem to produce actionable insisghts.

## 1. Situation
Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The Dataset has data about the time and station that the ride was started and the time and station that the ride was ended. 
## 2. Scenario/Task
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations

## 3. Strategy for Identifying User Trends
I performed exploratory Data analysis on 12 months Data of 2021 to figure out the differences in bahaviors of the Casual users vs Regular(Member) users.
I compared the following analysis:

1. Number of rides vs
- Day of week
- Month of year
- Time of Day
- Lnegth of trip
2. Quarter wise change in total number of rides
3. Type of bike used vs
- Day of the week
- Month of the Year
4. Average Length of trip Vs time of the day
5. number of trips by Quarter for Casual users vs Regular(member) users 


## 4. Data Cleaning and Data Processing

## 5. Insights and Reccomendations

### Insights
- There is strong seasonality in the use of bicycles as Chicago is too cold in the winter months so total use drops. Summer has very pleasant weather and casual users (perhaps tourists) also flock to this service int he summer
- There is strong seasonality in the use with the time od day as well. 6AM to 6PM time slot experiences a steady increase in the number of rides and then drops sharply after that upto 5 30 AM
- Casual users are mostly weekend users and Regular(member) users are mostly weekdy users.
- There is a predictable seasonality in the day of the week vs the number of total rides
- Regular users take longer ride on average and casual users take shorter rides

## 6. Major Learnings
1. Some operations are O(n^2), so we need to delay these steps till after the data model is ready. For e.g. Sorting and Deleting rows with blanks, nulls etc
2. Documenting the steps of your work is mroe important than doing the work once and forgetting what you did the last time.
